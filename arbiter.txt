#This is the arbiter program written for the split UNO game.

The program will start with an initialization of 20 cards in each players hand.

The program will ask for which number card/action card a player played, and the human arbiter will feed the output to the application.

The arbiter app will then keep updating the game state, and as per the instructions given and will announce winner, resolve dispute.
