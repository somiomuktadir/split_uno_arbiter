Split UNO is a variant of UNO created by me that adds a new dimension to the regular UNO game by seperating the number cards and action cards into seperate decks (also adding Truth and Dare Cards for the fun element). You win the game by shredding your number cards first (with an initial counter of 20 cards for each player). Each action card has their own function (0 and 7 cards have separate functions too). Find the detailed rules in the "ruleset.pdf" file and have fun! You can find the arbiter app of the game in this repository - that resolves disputes, and removes the pressure of constant maintainance of game state (with a little help from a human arbiter though, that makes the game neutral and promotes fair play). The code is written in cpp and can be compiled and run through any C++ compiler.

Current state : The arbiter app currently is in its initial commit and runs perfectly. Need to play a lot of demo games to ensure the smoothness of the code & enhanced clarity.
