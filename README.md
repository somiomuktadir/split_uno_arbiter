Split UNO is a variant of UNO created by me that adds a new dimension to the regular UNO game by seperating the number cards and action cards into seperate decks (also adding Truth and Dare Cards for the fun element). You win the game by shredding your number cards first (with an initial counter of 20 cards for each player). Each action card has their own function (0 and 7 cards have separate functions too). Find the detailed rules in the "ruleset.pdf" file and have fun!
