## Overview

**Split UNO** is a competitive card game variant that reimagines the classic UNO experience by separating number cards and action cards into distinct decks. This creates a unique strategic layer where players must manage two different types of resources while competing to be the first to shed all their number cards.

**Players:** 2-6  

---

## Game Setup

### Deck Preparation
Split UNO uses a standard 108-card UNO deck, divided into two separate decks:

- **Number Deck** (68 cards remaining after distribution)
  - Number cards 0-9 in four colors (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue)
  
- **Action Deck** (32 cards total)
  - Block/Skip cards (8 total)
  - Reverse cards (8 total)
  - Draw Two cards (8 total)
  - Wild cards (4 total)
  - Wild Draw Four cards (4 total)

### Initial Distribution
1. Each player receives **20 number cards** face down
2. Each player receives **0 action cards** initially
3. Place the Number Deck face down in the center
4. Place the Action Deck face down separately
5. No discard pile is created (count-based tracking only)

### Starting Player
Determine the starting player by any agreed method (youngest player, random selection, etc.)

---

## Game Components

### Player Hand
Each player maintains two separate card counts:
- **Number Cards:** Used for the primary bidding mechanic
- **Action Cards:** Used to disrupt opponents or gain advantages

### Deck State
- **Number Deck:** Remaining cards available for drawing
- **Action Deck:** Limited pool of powerful cards

---

## Core Gameplay

### Turn Structure
The game proceeds in rounds rather than traditional turns. Each round, players choose one of the following actions:

1. **Play a Number Round** - All non-blocked players participate
2. **Play an Action Card** - One player uses a strategic card

### Number Rounds

#### Standard Play
1. All non-blocked players simultaneously reveal one number card (0-9)
2. The player who played the **highest number wins** the round
3. **Winner:** Sheds the played card (discards it)
4. **Losers:** Keep their played card AND draw 1 penalty card from the Number Deck
5. **Consecutive Wins:** Track wins for bonus rewards

#### Ties
If multiple players tie for the highest card:
- All tied players shed their played cards
- All players (including tied players) draw 1 card from the Number Deck
- Consecutive win counters reset to 0 for tied players

#### Blocked Players
- Blocked players skip the entire round
- Their block status is removed after the round
- They do not play a card or draw a penalty

---

## Number Cards (0-9)

### Standard Numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9)
These cards have no special effects. Higher values are more likely to win the round but should be saved strategically.

### Card 0 - Steal
**Effect:** After revealing, the player who played 0 may **steal 1 random card** from any opponent of their choice.

**Rules:**
- Choose any opponent (even if they didn't play in the round)
- Opponent must have at least 1 number card to steal from
- The stolen card is random (opponent should shuffle and let you pick)
- This happens BEFORE the winner is determined

**Strategy Tip:** Card 0 has the lowest bid value but provides card advantage through theft.

### Card 7 - Draw Penalty
**Effect:** After revealing, choose one opponent. That opponent must **draw 2 number cards and 1 action card** from the respective decks.

**Rules:**
- Choose any opponent (excluding yourself)
- Opponent draws even if decks are exhausted (draw what's available)
- This happens BEFORE the winner is determined
- This is NOT optional

**Strategy Tip:** Card 7 is mid-value but can severely punish an opponent close to winning.

---

## Action Cards

Action cards are played **separately from number rounds**. When a player plays an action card, it is declared, resolved, and removed from their hand.

### BLOCK / SKIP
**Effect:** Block one opponent from participating in the next Number Round.

**Gameplay:**
1. Declare the target opponent
2. Target may counter by playing their own BLOCK card
3. **If countered:** Both players shed 1 number card and 1 action card. Neither is blocked.
4. **If not countered:** Target is blocked for the next Number Round only. Playing player sheds 1 action card.

**Strategic Notes:**
- Extremely powerful for eliminating competition in critical rounds
- Can be countered, so timing is key

---

### REVERSE (Swap Hands)
**Effect:** Exchange your entire hand (number AND action cards) with one target opponent.

**Gameplay:**
1. Declare the target opponent
2. Swap all number cards with the target
3. Swap all action cards with the target
4. The playing player sheds 1 action card (from their NEW hand after the swap)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Game-changing card when behind
- Can backfire if opponent has a worse hand than expected
- Cannot be countered

---

### COLOR CHANGE / WILD
**Effect:** All players shed 1 number card. Choose a color that one opponent must play on their next turn.

**Gameplay:**
1. All players (including you) discard 1 number card
2. Choose a color (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue)
3. Nominate one opponent who must play that color on their next number card play
4. The playing player sheds 1 action card

**Strategic Notes:**
- Useful for reducing everyone's hand size
- Color restriction is largely thematic (arbiter tracks intent, not enforcement)

---

### DRAW TWO (+2)
**Effect:** Force one opponent to draw 2 number cards OR engage in a draw battle.

**Gameplay:**
1. Declare the target opponent
2. Target may counter by playing their own +2 or +4
3. **If not countered:** Target draws 2 cards. Playing player sheds 1 action card.
4. **If countered with +2:** Both players shed their action cards. Both draw 1 number card (tie).
5. **If countered with +4:** Both players shed their action cards. Playing player draws **3 cards** (1 base + 2 difference).

**Draw Battle Formula:**
- If different values: Loser draws **(1 + difference)** cards
- If same values: Both draw 1 card

---

### DRAW FOUR (+4)
**Effect:** Force one opponent to draw 4 number cards OR engage in a draw battle.

**Gameplay:**
1. Declare the target opponent
2. Target may counter by playing their own +2 or +4
3. **If not countered:** Target draws 4 cards. Playing player sheds 1 action card.
4. **If countered with +4:** Both players shed their action cards. Both draw 1 number card (tie).
5. **If countered with +2:** Both players shed their action cards. Target draws **3 cards** (1 base + 2 difference).

**Strategic Notes:**
- Most aggressive penalty card
- Limited in the deck (only 4 total)
- Can be countered, creating massive swings

---

### TRUTH
**Effect:** Ask one opponent a personal truth question. If they refuse, they face a penalty.

**Gameplay:**
1. Declare the target opponent
2. Ask a truth question (appropriate for the game setting)
3. Opponent chooses:
   - **Answer truthfully:** No penalty
   - **Refuse to answer:** Playing player chooses ONE penalty:
     - **Penalty A:** Playing player draws 2 action cards, target draws 2 number cards
     - **Penalty B:** Target draws 5 number cards
4. Playing player sheds 1 action card AND 1 number card regardless

**Strategic Notes:**
- Social/fun card with strategic upside
- Even if answered, you lose 2 cards, so use wisely

---

### DARE
**Effect:** Challenge one opponent to complete a dare. If they refuse, **they forfeit the entire game**.

**Gameplay:**
1. Declare the target opponent
2. Issue a dare (must be reasonable and appropriate)
3. Opponent chooses:
   - **Complete the dare:** Playing player sheds 1 action card and 1 number card
   - **Refuse:** Opponent **forfeits the game**. Playing player wins immediately.

**Strategic Notes:**
- Nuclear option
- Dares should be fun, not humiliating
- Refusal is rare but ends the game

---

## Special Rules

### Consecutive Wins Bonus
When a player wins **2 consecutive Number Rounds**, they immediately receive a bonus:

**Choose ONE:**
1. Draw 1 action card from the Action Deck
2. All opponents draw 2 number cards

After claiming the bonus, the consecutive win counter resets to 0.

**Notes:**
- Consecutive wins reset if you lose or tie a round
- You must claim the bonus immediately when triggered

---

### Deck Exhaustion
If either deck runs out of cards:
- **Number Deck Exhausted:** Players can no longer draw number cards. Penalties become 0 cards drawn.
- **Action Deck Exhausted:** Players can no longer draw action cards. Action bonuses become 0 cards drawn.

**Strategic Impact:** Late-game deck exhaustion favors defensive play and action card usage.

---

## Winning the Game
### Primary Win Condition
The first player to reduce their **number cards to 0** has a chance to win, but opponents can challenge:

1. **Player reaches 0 number cards:** Game pauses
2. **Challenge Phase:** Any opponent may challenge by playing a +2 or +4 card
3. **If challenged:** The winning player must draw the penalty (2 or 4 cards). Game continues.
4. **If NOT challenged:** The player **wins the game immediately**.

### Challenge Rules
- Only ONE challenge is allowed per win attempt
- The challenging player must have a +2 or +4 card available
- The challenging player sheds their action card
- If the winning player survives the challenge (still at 0 cards after drawing), another challenge phase begins

### Alternative Win: DARE Forfeit
If a player refuses a DARE, the player who issued the dare wins immediately.

## Strategy Tips

1. **Balance Your Hand:** Don't burn all high cards early. Save some for critical moments.
2. **Action Card Economy:** Action cards are scarce. Use them when they'll have maximum impact.
3. **Card 0 & 7 Timing:** These special number cards can swing momentum. Use them when opponents are vulnerable.
4. **Consecutive Wins:** Aim for 2 wins in a row to gain tempo through bonuses.
5. **Challenge Meta:** When close to 0 cards, be aware of who has action cards remaining.
6. **Blocking:** Use BLOCK cards to remove threats from critical rounds.
7. **Psychology:** TRUTH and DARE cards add social dynamics. Use them to create memorable moments.

---

## Arbiter Tool

For ease of gameplay, a companion **Arbiter Application** (`arbiter.cpp`) is available to track:
- Each player's number and action card counts
- Consecutive win streaks
- Deck remaining counts
- Game state and block statuses

The arbiter does NOT validate specific cards played (honor system). It only tracks counts and enforces rules.

---

- Remove TRUTH and DARE cards for faster gameplay
